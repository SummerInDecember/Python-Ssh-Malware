# Python-Ssh-Malware
This program uses a silly calculator(just for showcasing for now, in the future I will add something smarter) to pretend that its just a calculator, but in the background it creates an ssh server on the victim's pc and uploads a file to mega.nz with all the info needed about the target.

THIS PROGRAM IS FOR LINUX TARGETS ONLY(ARCH LINUX)

I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSABILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS, THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
